# 1. Executive summary

Everybody’s Pet Care is a community-focused pet care service designed to provide affordable, compassionate, and reliable pet-sitting to underserved populations in Fort Collins, Colorado. Founded and operated by Nick Lieurance, a dedicated animal care provider, this project addresses a critical gap in support for unemployed individuals, people with disabilities, the elderly, and owners of reactive pets.

Our innovative model operates as a licensed and insured Limited Liability Company (LLC) for day-to-day operations, while seeking fiscal sponsorship with a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit to manage grant funding and tax-deductible donations. This structure ensures efficiency, accountability, and access to the resources needed to subsidize services for those in need.

Through a sliding-scale fee system, we will ensure that no one is forced to choose between their own well-being and the care of their animal companion. Our mission is to provide peace of mind and practical freedom to our clients, strengthening the human-animal bond in our community—because truly, everybody’s pet deserves care.
