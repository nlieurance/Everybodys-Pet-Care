# 7. Financial plan and funding request

## Revenue streams:

1. **Client fees (operational revenue)**: Sliding-scale payments paid directly to Everybody’s Pet Care, LLC. Covers a portion of baseline costs.
2. **Grants & donations (mission funding)**: Managed by the Fiscal Sponsor. Fuels the “Care for All” Fund, which subsidizes care for clients who cannot afford the full cost.

## Use of grant/donation funds:
Funds held by the Fiscal Sponsor will be used exclusively for:

- Subsidizing client care fees for low-income, disabled, or elderly clients.
- Purchasing program supplies (pet first-aid kits, waste bags, leashes, etc.).
- Outreach materials and website maintenance.
- Mileage reimbursement for client visits.

## Initial funding request:
We seek a Fiscal Sponsor to help secure $[Amount, e.g., $12,000–$18,000] in initial grants and donations. This would allow us to:
- Offer sponsored care slots to our most vulnerable clients in Year 1.
- Cover essential start-up outreach and operational costs.
- Build a track record of impact to attract ongoing community support.
