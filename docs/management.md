## Fiscal sponsorship model:
- This project seeks a formal partnership with a 501(c)(3) organization to serve as Fiscal Sponsor.
- The Fiscal Sponsor receives grants and tax-deductible donations designated for “Everybody’s Pet Care,” holds funds in a restricted account, and provides donors with tax receipts.
- Everybody’s Pet Care, LLC performs all program services and tracks related expenses.
- Nick Lieurance submits documentation for pre-approved mission expenses (e.g., supplies, mileage, and a portion of time dedicated to subsidized care) to the sponsor for reimbursement.
- This model ensures financial transparency, allows tax-deductible giving, and keeps the project focused on service delivery.
