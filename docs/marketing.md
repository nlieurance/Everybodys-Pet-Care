# 6. Marketing and outreach

Our outreach will prioritize genuine connections with referral partners and the community.

- **Partner outreach**: Direct collaboration with human service agencies, senior centers, disability advocacy groups, unemployment offices, veterinary clinics, and animal shelters.
- **Digital presence**: A clean, accessible website (everybodyspetcare.com) and social media to share stories, build trust, and explain the sliding-scale and sponsorship model.
- **Community visibility**: Attendance at local resource fairs, senior events, and pet wellness days to connect directly with potential clients and supporters.
