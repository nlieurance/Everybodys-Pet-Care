# 3. The problem & our solution

## The problem:
Vulnerable pet owners often face impossible choices due to the high cost and limited availability of specialized pet care. Seniors, individuals with disabilities, those experiencing unemployment, and owners of reactive dogs are frequently left without options, leading to stress, isolation, and even pet surrender.

## Our solution:
Everybody’s Pet Care provides personalized, in-home pet sitting through a single trusted provider—Nick Lieurance. This ensures consistency, deep understanding of each pet’s needs, and a relationship-based approach to care.
- **Accessible pricing**: A clear sliding-scale fee model ($5–$25 per visit), with the option for fully sponsored care through our “Care for All” fund.
- **Specialized expertise**: Skilled, fear-free handling for reactive, anxious, or medically complex pets.
- **Human-centered care**: We support the owner as much as the pet, providing respite and reliability when it’s needed most.
