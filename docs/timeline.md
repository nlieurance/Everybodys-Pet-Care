# 8. Timeline

## **Our sustainable pace approach**

**Founder commitment: 10 hours per week maximum**

1. **Service excellence** through deep client relationships
2. **Founder sustainability** without burnout
3. **Measured growth** that proves our model's viability
4. **Strategic focus** on our highest-impact clients

## **Capacity and impact metrics**

### **Weekly time allocation (Q3-Q4)**
| Activity | Hours/week | Percentage |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Direct client service | 8 | 80% |
| Administration & billing | 1 | 10% |
| Partnership development | 1 | 10% |
| **Total** | **10** | **100%** |

### **Service capacity mathematics**
- **8 service hours/week** = approximately 4 clients at 2 hours/week each
- **Realistic client load** = 5-6 clients with varying needs
- **Buffer time** = built in for travel and unexpected situations
- **Maximum annual impact** = 400-450 service hours (sustainable pace)

### **Financial projections**
| Quarter | Monthly revenue | Grant funding | Clients served |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Q1 | $0 | $0 | 0 |
| Q2 | $160-$240 | $5,000 | 2 |
| Q3 | $640-$800 | $10,000 | 5-6 |
| Q4 | $640-$800 | $5,000 | 6 |

*Based on sliding scale fees of $20-$40 per service hour*

## **Adjustment and decision points**

### **Quarterly review metrics**
We will make strategic decisions based on these quarterly assessments:

1. **End of Q1:** Are we legally ready and properly insured?
2. **End of Q2:** Is our service model working? Are clients satisfied?
3. **End of Q3:** Are we financially on track? Should we adjust pricing?
4. **End of Q4:** Should we continue at this pace, adjust hours, or expand?

### **Capacity management**
- **Waitlist initiation:** Begin at 4 active clients
- **Rate adjustments:** Consider at 6-month mark based on demand
- **Expansion consideration:** Only after 12 months of sustainable operation
- **Quality safeguards:** Client load never exceeds ability to provide excellent care
